ABOUT
  This is a simple application that will try to find a album art image (png or jpg) and add it directly into the metadata of all your mp3 files. It will look inside the folder of an mp3 or/and can also try to match a image downloaded from amarok. That way whenever you move or copy your collection somewhere else, all the album art stay with them. And yes, iTunes fully support this :)

DEPENDENCIES
  TagLib: For tag reading and writing (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html).
  OpenSSL: For generating hashes, to determine which image amarok uses (http://www.openssl.org/).

INSTALL
  On most system a simple `make` will do the trick, provide you have all of the above dependencies properly installed on your system. If that fails, try something like this:

    g++ -O2 -o covertagger covertagger.cpp `taglib-config --libs --cflags` \
    -I<path_to_include_folder_of_openssl> -lssl -DVERSION="\"1.0\""

  After that, just copy the executable where you want.

USAGE
  covertagger [PATH(s) TO YOUR MUSIC] [OPTIONS]
  covertagger [OPTIONS] [PATH(s) TO YOUR MUSIC]
  
  Covertagger will descend recursively into each directories specified and build a list containing all the mp3 files it found.

  Example: covertagger ~/music -afv

OPTIONS
  You must at least use the -f or -a options, otherwise nothing will happen. Once the output looks like what you want, rerun covertagger adding the -m option to actually modifiy your files. If both -f and -a are specified and a album art image is found by both method, then the image found by the -f option has the priority.

  -m (modify)
  No files will be modified unless this flag is specified.

  -a (amarok)
  Looks for album art from amarok files. Usually those are at ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/albumcovers/large/

  -f (folder)
  Look for a jpg or a png in the same folder as the mp3. Will look for a file named (C|c)over or (A|a)lbum or (F|f)older or (F|f)ront with extension .jpg or .jpeg or .png.

  -r (replace)
  Replace album art if there is already one present. If none was found with the -f and/or -a options, the file is untouched.

  -d (delete)
  If no album art is found with the -f and/or -a options, delete album art from the mp3 file.

  -x (delete all)
  Delete all album art from every mp3 and exit.

  -l (list no cover)
  List all files without album art and exit.

  -v (verbrose)
  Print more information along the way.

  -q (quiet)
  Print less information along the way.

  -h (help)
